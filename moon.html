    <H2 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, orbiting at an average distance of 384399 km (238,854 mi; about 30 times Earth's diameter). It faces Earth always with the same side. This is a result of Earth's gravitational pull having synchronized the Moon's rotation period (lunar day) with its orbital period (lunar month) of 29.5 Earth days. The Moon's pull on Earth is the main driver of Earth's tides.
<BR>
        In geophysical terms, the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. Its mass is 1.2% that of the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as the contiguous United States).
        <BR>
             Within the Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth-largest and fifth-most massive moon overall, and larger and more massive than all known dwarf planets.[17] Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's, about half that of Mars, and the second-highest among all moons in the Solar System, after Jupiter's moon Io.
             <BR>
                 The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.
        <BR>
        The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks, rilles and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria ('seas'), which are plains of cooled lava. These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into ancient impact basins. The Moon is, except when passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar phases.[18] The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky. 
        <BR>
            This is mainly due to its large angular diameter, while the reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun completely during a total solar eclipse. From Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is visible due to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible.
        <BR>
        The Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge for humans, having been crucial to cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. The first human-made objects to fly to an extraterrestrial body were sent to the Moon, starting in 1959 with the flyby of the Soviet Union's Luna 1 and the intentional impact of Luna 2.
        <BR>
             In 1966, the first soft landing (by Luna 9) and orbital insertion (by Luna 10) followed. On July 20, 1969, humans for the first time stepped on an extraterrestrial body, landing on the Moon at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander Eagle of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. Five more crews were sent between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. The longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. Since then, exploration of the Moon has continued robotically, and crewed missions are being planned to return beginning in the late 2020s.

                The English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is typically written as Moon, with a capital M.[19][20] The noun moon is derived from Old English mōna, which stems from Proto-Germanic *mēnōn,[21] which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European *mēnsis 'month'[22] (from earlier *mēnōt, genitive *mēneses) which may be related to the verb 'measure' (of time).[23]

Occasionally, the name Luna /ˈluːnə/ is used in scientific writing[24] and especially in science fiction to distinguish the Earth's moon from others, while in poetry "Luna" has been used to denote personification of the Moon.[25] Cynthia /ˈsɪnθiə/ is a rare poetic name for the Moon personified as a goddess,[26] while Selene /səˈliːniː/ (literally 'Moon') is the Greek goddess of the Moon.
<BR>

The English adjective pertaining to the Moon is lunar, derived from the Latin word for the Moon, lūna. Selenian /səliːniən/[27] is an adjective used to describe the Moon as a world, rather than as a celestial object,[28] but its use is rare.
<BR>
     It is derived from σελήνη selēnē, the Greek word for the Moon, and its cognate selenic was originally a rare synonym[29] but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium.[30] The element name selenium and the prefix seleno- (as in selenography, the study of the physical features of the Moon) come from this Greek word.[31][32]
<BR>
Artemis, the Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, also came to be identified with Selene, and was sometimes called Cynthia after her birthplace on Mount Cynthus.[33] Her Roman equivalent is Diana. The names Luna, Cynthia, and Selene are reflected in technical terms for lunar orbits such as apolune, pericynthion and selenocentric.
<BR>
The astronomical symbols for the Moon are the crescent ☽ and decrescent ☾, for example in M☾ 'lunar mass'.
