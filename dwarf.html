    <p>Explore the fascinating world of dwarf planets, the remnants from the formation of our solar system.</p>


    <h2>What Are Dwarf planets?</h2>
    <p>Dwarf planets are celestial bodies that orbit the Sun, are round due to gravity, but haven't cleared their orbital neighborhood of other objects, unlike planets, and are not moons. </p>

        <P>A dwarf planet is a small planetary-mass object that is in direct orbit around the Sun, massive enough to be gravitationally rounded, but insufficient to achieve orbital dominance like the eight classical planets of the Solar System. The prototypical dwarf planet is Pluto, which for decades was regarded as a planet before the "dwarf" concept was adopted in 2006.

            Dwarf planets are capable of being geologically active, an expectation that was borne out in 2015 by the Dawn mission to Ceres and the New Horizons mission to Pluto. Planetary geologists are therefore particularly interested in them.
            
            Astronomers are in general agreement that at least the nine largest candidates are dwarf planets â€“ in rough order of diameter, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Sedna, Ceres, and Orcus. A considerable uncertainty remains over the tenth largest candidate Salacia, which may thus be considered a borderline case. Of these ten, two have been visited by spacecraft (Pluto and Ceres) and seven others have at least one known moon (Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Orcus, and Salacia), which allows their masses and thus an estimate of their densities to be determined.
